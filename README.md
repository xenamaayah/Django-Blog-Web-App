# Django-Blog-Web-App

I have created a complete Django blog application using Django 4.1 following the book 
[*Django 4 by Example*](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-4-by-example) by Antonio 
Mel√©.


As per the book, this blog project encompasses the following:
- Building data models, views, and URLS
- Implementing an administration site for the blog
- Using canonical URLS for the models and implementing SEO-friendly URLs for posts
- Building post pagination and creating class-based views. 
- Using forms to allow users to share posts via email. 
- Implementing a comment system using model forms. 
- Adding tags to posts using [django-taggit](https://github.com/jazzband/django-taggit) and recommending similar posts based on shared tags.
- Implementing custom template tags to display the latest posts and most commented posts.
- Implementing a custom template filter to render [Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown).
- Creating a sitemap and a RSS feed for the blog.
